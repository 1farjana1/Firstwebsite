            <p>The Persian cat (Persian: گربه ایرانی‎, romanized: Gorbe Īrānī) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the English-speaking countries. In the Middle East region, they are widely known as "Shirazi cats" and in Iran they are known as "Shiraz cat". The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from Iran (historically known as Persia in the west) around 1620.</p>

        <h3 class="high">About me</h3>
        <p>The selective breeding carried out by breeders has allowed the development of a wide variety of coat colors, but has also led to the creation of increasingly flat-faced Persians. Favored by fanciers, this head structure can bring with it a number of health problems. As is the case with the Siamese breed, there have been efforts by some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the traditional breed, having a more pronounced muzzle, which is more popular with the general public. Hereditary polycystic kidney disease is prevalent in the breed, affecting almost half the population in some countries.[3][</p>

        <p>The Persian Sarabi Dog is giant with heavy bones with a very big molosser head. The broad muzzle is neither too long or too short. It has somewhat smaller dewlaps than some other giant mastiff breeds, but the upper lips do hang down. Eyes are almond shaped with a dark yellow color.The Persian Sarabi Dog is giant with heavy bones with a very big molosser head. The broad muzzle is neither too long or too short.
